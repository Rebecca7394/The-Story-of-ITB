			<h3> Interview with Ben</h3>
			<ol> 
				<li>How has your experience been in ITB so far?</li>
					<p> Since I started college last September, I have been taking every oppertunity ITB has thrown at me. I am active in the campus gym and play football for the college team. Having a good social life in college has really benefitted me but its important to have a balance between work and activities. </p>
				<li>What do you like about the campus at ITB? </li>
					<p> The facilities are great in ITB from the sportshall, the gym and the allweather pitch! The campus always has a great atmosphere and has events to get students invloved.</p>
				<li> What changes would you like to see in ITB as we tranittion to TUD?</li>
					<p> I'd like to have more interaction with the other colleges, DIT and ITT. It would be great to have access to facilities in the other colleges as well as getting to know some more students! </p>

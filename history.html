			<h2> The history of IT Blanchardstown</h2>
			
			<p> ITB was established in 1999, where the college opened its doors for the first time, with a different logo and a tiny campus which consisted only of the A block.  There were very little courses to choose from at this time and it was advertised - “If you are a risk taker, join us”. The college was very unestablished at this time and only had a few courses to choose from.There was very little industry at the time and was advertised through radio and flyers. In 2000 a robotics summer camp was set up on the campus. 2002 first graduate year in ITB. In 2004 all buildings were opened. This big event lead to visitors such as politics and Berty Ahern, this gained recognition for ITB.  In 2006 the first institute plan was installed with better marketing to secondary schools and potential students. The new and improved logo was also designed as the old logo was having problems working on the web. In 2009 the Creative Digital Media course was launched in ITB. Between 2009 and 2010 ITB began to use social media as a resource. A bebo account, Facebook account and Twitter was set up to promote ITB and to inform students about updates and news within the college. In 2009 ITB celebrated their 10th year anniversary. A community day took place with fun activities set up for children and a staff reunion took place.  In 2012 TUD was signed by DIT, ITT and ITB. The legislation was being debated in 2016 but fell through and took two months for it to pass. In 2018 it was signed by the president. In May 2018 an audit was sent to all colleges and each college passed. On the 18th of July the applicted passed and TU Dublin was announced by the president. </p>
			<br>
			<p> ITB has really come a long way when reminising on the past, but the most exciting part is the ITB future. </p>

			<h3> Interview with Megan</h3>
			<ol> 
				<li>Are you looking forward to the transition between secondary school and college?</li>
					<p> Im excited, but it is also nerve wrecking to think about it. I think it will take me awhile to get my head around being treated like an adult rather than being instructed by a teacher. Im really looking forward to the college experience as my friends who are in college have a lot of fun around campus and on college nights out. Im really looking forward to studying something that I find interesting, I tend to lose a lot of focus in school when its a subject that doesn't appeal to me. </p>
				
				<li>What qualties would you like your future college to have? </li>
					<p> A fun, active campus with a variety of activies that take place for students to get involved. Nice staff who are passionate about what they teach. Acess to computers and equipment in college and a nice canteen, the ones in secondary school are terrible!</p>
				
				<li> Why would you consider studying at ITB in the future?</li>
					<p> After attending the open day and getting an insight to the college and the courses avilable at ITB, I really liked the layout and structor of the college. I love photography and after hearing about the Creative Digital Media course, it seemed right up my ally! The students and staff were really helpful when I had a question.</p>

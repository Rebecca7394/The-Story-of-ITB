			<h3> Interview with James</h3>
			<ol> 
				<li>How did your time at ITB benefit you in your work?</li>
					<p> When I first heard of the Creative Digital Media course at ITB, I knew it was something I was going to really enjoy. Academic courses weren't for me, I was creative and expessed myself best in this field. I went into the course with an open mind, I wasn't particulary talented at any module but was keen to learn. When I started doing design in college something really clicked, I found my feet and began designing in my free time. Knowing a lot of people in the music industry I was given the opertunity to design the promotion for their nights. After a year or two I was then hired as designer for the District Magazine and District nights. If it wasn't for ITB I might have never found my calling in the design industry. </p>
				<li>What was your favourite part of attending ITB? </li>
					<p> Learning new skills and being taught by passionate lectures, getting to know new people with simular interests as you and enjoying the college experience. </p>
				<li>What life qualties and skills have you gained from attending ITB?</li>
					<p> Not to be afraid to ask for help, people are there to help you! I matured during my time at ITB and found my feet. I gained a lot of social skills from meeting tones of new people and came out of my shell. </p>
